        <br>
        <p>Throughout her career and undergrad years, she was also contract hired to work for the Illinois Restaurant Association in the Chicago Gourmet department, where she helped coordinate Chicago's only premier food and wine festival in 2016 and 2017.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Her work was all focused one aspect: people. Whether through teaching, giving back to the community, or throwing lavish events for entertainment, she excels in all environments.</p>

        <p>Now, she is ready for a new challenge. Her most recent project and role was heavily involved in consulting, strategic operations, and content management. She is eager to learn all the ins and outs of web development and wants to expand her skill set constantly. However, she still dreams of becoming a rapper. One day. You will see. Jenni is also a big fan of Tupac and believes he is still alive.</p>
